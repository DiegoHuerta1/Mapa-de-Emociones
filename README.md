# BERT and SOM Emotions Map

The objective of this project is to use BERT and SOM neural networks to perform sentiment analysis. The interest lies in the topological space where the BERT network generates embeddings, which will be visualized using the SOM network.

A BERT neural network has been fine-tuned for the task of sentiment classification. Although this network can take sentences and assign them a sentiment, the focus is on the sentence embeddings it generates. Remember that when a BERT network processes a sentence as input, the vector associated with the CLS token can be used as the sentence embedding. Therefore, BERT neural networks can be seen as a method for sentence vectorization. Since the BERT model was trained for sentiment classification, it has particular expertise in this area. As such, it can be used to create sentence embeddings where the sentiment of the sentence plays a crucial role in generating the embedding.

The goal is to visualize the BERT embedding space. For this purpose, a SOM (Self-Organizing Map) network is used. These networks can visualize high-dimensional topological spaces. A SOM will be trained on the BERT embedding space to visualize how emotions are distributed within it. The aim is to produce an emotion map, which is the representation of the BERT embedding space generated by the SOM.

To achieve this, a set of sentences with labeled sentiments is used. These sentences are vectorized using BERT, and then the emotion map of these vectors is obtained using the SOM.

Obtaining the emotion map is useful for observing how BERT separates emotions from one another (which is expected). In other words, it can provide insights into how BERT embeddings are constructed. Additionally, as illustrated at the end of the project, the emotion map can be used to assign emotions to sentences not present in the dataset.
